# Bacon-Number-Calculator
This repository is cloned from my work done in "MSCI 240 - Data Structures & Algorithms".

This project consisted of:
- implementing a Java program by manipulating well-known BFS and DFS algorithms to find the degrees of separation between two nodes in a given graph that represent actors in the IMDb
- defining objects in Java with knowledge of OOP, data structures, and statistics to calculate various data points of a graph’s connected components and a source node’s relationship to the graph

In the file "code", there are 4 objects and 1 main program which I use the 4 objects. The objects I created were:
- DFSTree
- BFSTree
- Statistics
